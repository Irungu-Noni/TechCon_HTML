            <h2>History</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>🌱 The Birth of Tech Conferences</b></li>
                <p>TechCon traces its inspiration to pioneering events like the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956—the very first AI conference—and early industry gatherings such as Unix Expo (first held in 1984) and RSA Conference (from 1991). These events shaped the blueprint for innovation-focused meetups, blending academic insight with real-world tech trends. <br>
                Early conferences were intimate yet profound, often hosted at universities or trade centers, where groundbreaking tools and ideas were unveiled—similar to how TechCon now focuses on sharing futuristic concepts in a creative, chill setting.</p>
                <li><b>📈 Rapid Growth in between 1990s and 2000s</b></li>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unix Expo peaked at ~35,000 attendees, featuring major reveals from AT&T, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, and even Steve Jobs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The First International World-Wide Web Conference (1994, CERN) earned the nickname "Woodstock of the Web" and set the tone for open-minded, collaborative tech gatherings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Over time, conferences like RSA and others added business focus, vendor halls, and high-profile keynotes, blending corporate insight with creative flair.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <li><b>🎥 TechCon’s Conceptual Foundations</b></li>
                <p>While TechCon itself is a creative, futuristic reimagining, its roots echo these milestones:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sharing cutting-edge demos like those at Unix Expo</li>
                    <li>Blending academic talks and business insights as at RSA</li>
                    <li>Fostering a creative, inclusive atmosphere à la the Web first big events</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <li><b>📱 Digital & Hybrid Transformation</b></li>
                <p>Post-2000, many conferences went hybrid—or fully virtual—especially after 2020, using live-streaming, breakout chats, and video platforms to reach global audiences. This shift has made tech events more accessible, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate.<br>
                TechCon imagines this next-gen vibe: interactive live streams, chill lounges, and immersive digital lounges.</p>
